The main difference is the fact that, with HTTP 2.0, a server can push resources to the client even without the client requesting them, just because it knows that the client will end up needing them.

The syntax of HTTP 1 will still be available, but the actual data will communicate in a different way.

It also has various other benefits like request prioritisation or multiplexing.
